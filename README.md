# A-star-lib
Code for the A* Lib that we will use to control the shelf

THIS IS A WIP, It will be done Soon(tm)

The objective of this project is to generate a list of moves in order to translate a desired box to another position without going over another box.
We consider that the box that has the index 0 is empty and therefore, it can be moved.
